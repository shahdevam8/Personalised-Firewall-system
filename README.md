# 🔐 Personal Firewall using Python (Kali Linux)

A lightweight **custom personal firewall** built using **Python, Scapy, and iptables** that monitors, analyzes, and filters incoming network traffic based on user-defined security rules.

This project is designed for **learning firewall internals, packet inspection, and SOC-level network security concepts**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Monitor real-time network traffic
- Analyze packets (IP, Port, Protocol)
- Apply rule-based filtering
- Block malicious or unwanted traffic
- Log allowed and blocked packets
- Understand how firewalls work internally

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time packet sniffing
- ✅ IP-based traffic blocking
- ✅ Port-based filtering (e.g., Telnet, SMB)
- ✅ Protocol-level validation (TCP / UDP)
- ✅ iptables-based enforcement (real firewall rules)
- ✅ Traffic logging for auditing
- ✅ Simple JSON-based rule management
- ✅ Kali Linux compatible
- ✅ SOC / Cybersecurity interview ready
